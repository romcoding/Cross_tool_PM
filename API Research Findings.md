# API Research Findings

This document summarizes the findings of the API research for the project setup automation tool.

## Productive API

The Productive API documentation is available at [https://developer.productive.io/](https://developer.productive.io/). It is a JSON API that uses token-based authentication.

### Key Findings:

*   **Authentication:** Requires an API token and organization ID to be sent in the headers of each request.
*   **Resource Allocation:** The documentation does not explicitly mention a resource allocation endpoint. I will need to investigate further to see if this is possible through a combination of other endpoints, such as creating projects and assigning users.
*   **Project Creation:** The documentation does not explicitly mention a project creation endpoint. I will need to investigate further to see if this is possible through a combination of other endpoints.

I will now proceed to research the Jira API.




## Jira API

The Jira Cloud Platform REST API documentation is available at [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/). It is a REST API that uses OAuth 2.0 or basic authentication.

### Key Findings:

*   **Authentication:** Supports OAuth 2.0 for apps and basic authentication for scripts.
*   **Project Creation:** The API provides an endpoint for creating projects. I will need to investigate the specific parameters required for creating different project types (Software, Core, Service Management).
*   **User Management:** The API provides endpoints for adding users to projects and assigning them to roles.

I will now proceed to research the Confluence API.




## Confluence API

The Confluence Cloud REST API documentation is available at [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/). It is a REST API that uses JWT or OAuth 2.0 for app authentication and basic authentication for direct API calls.

### Key Findings:

*   **Authentication:** Supports JWT or OAuth 2.0 for apps and basic authentication for scripts.
*   **Space Creation:** The API provides an endpoint for creating spaces.
*   **Template Application:** The documentation does not explicitly mention a way to apply a template to a space directly. However, it is possible to create a page from a template. I will need to investigate if I can create a space and then create the required pages from a template within that space.

I will now proceed to research the Microsoft Graph API.




## Microsoft Graph API

The Microsoft Graph API documentation is available at [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/). It is a REST API that uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

### Key Findings:

*   **Authentication:** Uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
*   **Calendar Event Creation:** The API provides an endpoint for creating calendar events. It is possible to create events in a user's calendar or a group calendar, and to add attendees.

I have now completed the initial research for all the requested APIs.




## In-depth Productive API Research

My initial research indicated that the Productive API did not have endpoints for project creation. However, upon further investigation, I have found that the API does indeed support project creation, as well as other project management functionalities.

### Key Findings:

*   **Project Creation:** The API has a `POST /api/v2/projects` endpoint for creating projects.
*   **Resource Allocation:** While there is no direct "resource allocation" endpoint, it is possible to assign a `project_manager_id` and other team members (`person_id`) to a project. This will allow us to allocate resources to projects.
*   **Other Functionalities:** The API also supports updating, archiving, restoring, deleting, and copying projects.

This new information confirms that the Productive integration is more feasible than I initially thought. I will now update the system architecture and questionnaire design to reflect these new findings.
